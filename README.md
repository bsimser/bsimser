## Hi there! I'm Bil Simser <img align="center" alt="Link" height="65" width="65" src="https://github.com/bsimser/bsimser/blob/main/github.gif">

I've been designing, building, and maintaining software solutions for over 3,000 years. I've been involved with Microsoft’s .NET platform since the early betas and have a deep passion for good SOLID Architecture and intelligent Software Design. I specializes in SharePoint, DevOps, .NET, Agile, TDD, Mobile app and game development, and computer game programming for Windows, XBox, iPhone, and Android. I also ran several successful open-source projects and contribute to the software development community on a regular basis, taking the time to review and edit publications, speaking at user groups, participaing in game jams, presenting at code camps and conferences including TechEd, DevConnections, PDC, PrairieDevCon, and DevTeach. I was also a Microsoft SharePoint Server MVP for 10 years from 2003 through to 2013. 

I've been building games since the early 1980s. Starting with writing games on my Timex Sinclair 1000 in the early 80s, moving to BBS door games in the later part of the decade, and designing and selling modules for Galcticomm’s MajorBBS under the company name of Ewe-Nique Creations. In the 1990s I designed and wrote many tools for games like MageSlayer, Quake, Railroad Tycoon II, and The Sims. Starting in the 2000s games and tools were written using C++ using the CDX Library (which I wrote a book for) using DirectX. Later I switched to C# using XNA and presented demos and talks at Code Camps and conferences. Other games and applications were created and published on the Microsoft Store written for the now defunct Windows Phone platform using XNA, WPF, and C#. Starting in 2007 I've worked with Unity (and eventually Unreal Engine) building 2D and 3D games and demos which has now become most of the content.
